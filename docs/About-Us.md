## [Gastric Cancer Registry](https://gcregistry.stanford.edu/)
The Gastric Cancer Registry (GCR), established at the Stanford University School of Medicine in 2011, is the first comprehensive registry on stomach cancer in the nation. Our researchers utilize clinical samples to conduct sophisticated and advanced genomic analyses and compile information from a large group of people. This includes studies that identify gastric cancer’s molecular complexities and map associations between specific genetic errors and a patient’s prognosis and outcome.

The GCR provides a vital bridge between the community of individuals affected by gastric cancer and biomedical researchers wishing to determine the fundamental molecular causes of gastric cancer and their clinical ramifications. By gathering data and samples from patients across the country and the world, we aim to provide an excellent data set for all researchers who want to study gastric cancer.  We hope to facilitate research collaborations across a range of scientific endeavors including epidemiology, survivorship, prevention, treatment, genetics and more.

The Gastric Cancer Registry was created with the generosity of Diane and Ronald Weintraub, in memory of their beloved daughter Beth Weintraub Schoenfeld.

## [Ji Research Group](https://dna-discovery.stanford.edu)
Partnered with Gastric Cancer Registry, Stanford Ji Research Group is focused on accelerating and enabling personalized cancer medicine to patients to improve the lives of individuals with cancer. They have embarked on a research initiative to use cutting edge genetics and technology to interrogate the fundamental genetic "digital" code responsible for cancer development and overall clinical behavior.

## cBioPortal Software
The cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics was originally developed at [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center](http://www.mskcc.org/) (MSK). The [public cBioPortal site](http://cbioportal.org) is hosted by the [Center for Molecular Oncology](http://www.mskcc.org/research/molecular-oncology) at MSK. The cBioPortal software is now available under an open source license via [GitHub](https://github.com/cBioPortal/cbioportal/). The software is now developed and maintained by a multi-institutional team, consisting of MSK, the Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre in Toronto, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, [The Hyve](http://thehyve.nl) in the Netherlands, and Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
